# Clerk + Convex Authentication Setup Guide

## ✅ Completed Steps

All code changes have been implemented! Here's what's been done:

1. ✅ Installed `@clerk/nextjs` package
2. ✅ Created `middleware.ts` for route protection
3. ✅ Updated `ConvexClientProvider` to use `ConvexProviderWithClerk`
4. ✅ Wrapped app with `<ClerkProvider>` in root layout
5. ✅ Created sign-in and sign-up pages with dark theme
6. ✅ Added `UserButton` to desktop header
7. ✅ Created `useOrganization()` hook for dynamic org management
8. ✅ Added authentication checks to all Convex backend functions
9. ✅ Replaced all hardcoded `"org_demo"` with dynamic organization IDs

## 🔧 Final Configuration Steps (Do These Now)

### Step 1: Configure Convex Dashboard

1. Go to your Convex dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select your `treeshopterminal` project
3. Click on **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Click **"Auth"** tab
5. Click **"Add Auth Provider"**
6. Select **"Clerk"**
7. Enter your Clerk domain (found in Clerk dashboard):
   - Format: `your-app-name.clerk.accounts.dev`
   - Example: `close-tomcat-64.clerk.accounts.dev`
8. Click **"Save"**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in Vercel (already done ✅):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_Y2xvc2UtdG9tY2F0LTY0...
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_eHWVHT9n4nn106Y0GQNG4e3b64urKHSTpdFFHEKLxS
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=<your-convex-url>
```

### Step 3: Test the Authentication Flow

1. **Start the dev server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lockin/treeshopterminal
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test the flow:**
   - Visit http://localhost:3002
   - You should be redirected to `/sign-in`
   - Create a new account or sign in
   - After sign-in, you should see the dashboard
   - Check that the UserButton appears in the top-right corner

3. **Test data isolation:**
   - Add some equipment or employees
   - Log out and create a different account
   - Verify that the new account sees NO data from the first account
   - This confirms multi-tenant data isolation is working!

## 🎯 What's Been Secured

### Frontend Protection
- ✅ All routes require authentication (except /sign-in and /sign-up)
- ✅ Middleware intercepts unauthenticated requests
- ✅ User profile button for account management

### Backend Protection
- ✅ All Convex queries require authentication via `getCurrentOrganizationId()`
- ✅ All Convex mutations verify organization access
- ✅ Users can only access their own organization's data
- ✅ Automatic organization ID injection from Clerk JWT

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
- ✅ Each user/organization sees only their own data
- ✅ No hardcoded organization IDs
- ✅ Clerk handles user → organization mapping
- ✅ Convex enforces data isolation at the database level

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **JWT-based authentication** - Secure tokens from Clerk
2. **Server-side verification** - All Convex functions verify auth
3. **Route protection** - Middleware blocks unauthenticated access
4. **Organization isolation** - Users can't access other orgs' data
5. **Token rotation** - Clerk handles token refresh automatically

## 📝 How Authentication Works

1. User signs in via Clerk
2. Clerk issues JWT with user ID and organization ID
3. Frontend sends JWT to Convex with every request
4. Convex verifies JWT and extracts organization ID
5. Database queries are scoped to that organization
6. Data isolation is enforced automatically

## 🚀 Next Steps

After completing the Convex dashboard configuration:

1. **Deploy to production:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add Clerk authentication and multi-tenant security"
   git push
   ```

2. **Create your first organization:**
   - Sign up for an account
   - Clerk will auto-create your personal organization
   - Start adding equipment and employees!

3. **Invite team members** (optional):
   - Go to Clerk dashboard → Organizations
   - Invite team members to your organization
   - They'll share access to the same data

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Make sure you configured Clerk in Convex dashboard (Step 1 above)
- Verify your Clerk domain is correct
- Check browser console for JWT errors

### Can't sign in
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY is set
- Check that middleware.ts is at the root level
- Restart dev server after env changes

### Data not showing
- Check that useOrganization() hook is being called
- Verify Convex functions are using getCurrentOrganizationId()
- Look for errors in Convex dashboard logs

## 📚 Code Reference

### Key Files Modified
- `/middleware.ts` - Route protection
- `/app/layout.tsx` - ClerkProvider wrapper
- `/components/providers/ConvexClientProvider.tsx` - Convex + Clerk integration
- `/convex/auth.ts` - Authentication helpers
- `/lib/hooks/useOrganization.ts` - Organization context hook
- All `/convex/*.ts` files - Added auth checks
- All `/app/**/page.tsx` files - Dynamic org IDs

### Authentication Pattern

**Frontend:**
```typescript
import { useOrganization } from '@/lib/hooks/useOrganization';

const { organizationId } = useOrganization();
const data = useQuery(api.table.list, organizationId ? {} : 'skip');
```

**Backend:**
```typescript
import { getCurrentOrganizationId, verifyOrganizationAccess } from './auth';

export const list = query({
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    const orgId = await getCurrentOrganizationId(ctx);
    await verifyOrganizationAccess(ctx, orgId);
    // ... query data for orgId
  },
});
```
