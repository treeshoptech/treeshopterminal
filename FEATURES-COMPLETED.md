  perimeter: number         // Miles
  createdAt: timestamp
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

**Convex Functions:**

- Timeline estimate
- Back button to edit
- "Create Work Order" button

**Action:**
- Saves quote to `quotes` table
- Creates work order in `workOrders` table
- Shows success alert
- Closes modal
- Refreshes work orders list

---

### 3. Quote Generation System (COMPLETE)

**File:** `/components/work-orders/WorkOrderWizard.tsx` (calculateQuote function)

**Pricing Formulas Used:**
- `calculateInchAcres(acres, dbh)` - Forestry mulching
- `calculateStumpScore(stump)` - Stump grinding
- Production rate constants from `lib/formulas/pricing.ts`
- Default margin settings (30%, 50%)

**Forestry Mulching Calculation:**
```typescript
inchAcres = totalAcres × dbhPackage
mulchingHours = inchAcres ÷ 1.3  // Cat 265 production rate
transportHours = 1.5 hrs × 0.5    // 45min drive at 50% rate
bufferHours = (mulching + transport) × 0.10
totalHours = mulching + transport + buffer
lowPrice = totalHours × $312      // 30% margin
highPrice = totalHours × $437     // 50% margin
```

**Stump Grinding Calculation:**
```typescript
For each stump:
  stumpScore = diameter² × (heightAbove + depthBelow)
totalScore = sum of all stumpScores
grindingHours = max(0.5, totalScore ÷ 400)  // 30min minimum
transportHours = 1.0 hrs × 0.3    // 30% rate for small trailer
bufferHours = (grinding + transport) × 0.10
totalHours = grinding + transport + buffer
lowPrice = totalHours × $284
highPrice = totalHours × $397
```

**Land Clearing Calculation:**
```typescript
workHours = projectDays × 8
transportHours = 1.0 hrs × 0.5
totalHours = work + transport
lowPrice = totalHours × $605
highPrice = totalHours × $871
```

**Scope of Work (Auto-Generated):**

*Forestry:*
- "X.XX acres forestry mulching"
- "All vegetation up to X" diameter"
- "Estimated X hours on-site work"

*Stumps:*
- "X stump(s) ground below grade"
- "Standard 12" grind depth"
- "Estimated X hours grinding time"

*Land:*
- "Complete land clearing"
- "Heavy equipment and professional operators"
- "All debris removal and site cleanup"
- "Estimated X days on-site (X hours)"

**What's Included (Standard):**
- Professional equipment and operators
- Round-trip transport and logistics
- Site cleanup and restoration
- Safety compliance and insurance

### 4. Database Integration (COMPLETE)

**New Convex Functions:**

`convex/quotes.ts`:
```typescript
quotes.list({ organizationId })      // Get all quotes
quotes.get({ id })                    // Get single quote
quotes.create({ ...quoteData })       // Create quote
quotes.remove({ id })                 // Delete quote
```

**Quote Schema:**
```typescript
{
  organizationId: string
  serviceType: 'forestry_mulching' | 'stump_grinding' | 'land_clearing'
  workAreaIds: Id<'workAreas'>[]
  lowPrice: number
  highPrice: number
  estimatedHours: number
  scopeOfWork: string[]
  whatsIncluded: string[]
  calculationDetails: {
    totalAcres: number
    dbh?: number
    stumps?: StumpData[]
    projectDays?: number
  }
  createdAt: timestamp
}
```
