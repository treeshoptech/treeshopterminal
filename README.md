   ↓
2. System calculates acres using Google Maps Geometry API
   ↓
3. User names and saves work area
   → Convex: workAreas.create()
   ↓
4. User opens Work Order Wizard
   ↓
5. User selects job site
   ↓
6. System loads work areas for that site
   → Convex: workAreas.list({ jobSiteId })
   ↓
7. User selects work area(s)
   ↓
8. System sums total acres
   ↓
9. User selects service type and configures
   ↓
10. System calculates quote using pricing formulas
    - calculateInchAcres() for mulching
    - calculateStumpScore() for stumps
    - Production rates from constants
    - Applies margins (30%, 50%)
    ↓
11. User reviews quote
    ↓
12. User confirms
    → Convex: quotes.create()
    → Convex: workOrders.create()
    ↓
13. Work order created with linked quote
